# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions to common issues encountered in the CI/CD pipeline.

## 1. Build Failures
### Cause:
- Missing dependencies.
- Incorrect build tool configuration (Maven/Gradle).

### Solution:
- Check the build logs for missing dependencies.
- Ensure the correct build tool is specified in the workflow (e.g., `maven` or `gradle`).
- Run `mvn clean install` or `./gradlew build` locally to reproduce the error.

## 2. Docker Image Build Failures
### Cause:
- Incorrect Dockerfile.
- Missing environment variables or secrets.

### Solution:
- Verify that the `Dockerfile` is correctly configured.
- Ensure that all required secrets (e.g., `HARBOR_USERNAME`, `HARBOR_PASSWORD`) are set in GitHub Secrets.
- Run `docker build` locally to test the image build process.

## 3. Kubernetes Deployment Failures
### Cause:
- Incorrect Kubernetes configuration.
- Insufficient resources in the cluster.

### Solution:
- Check Kubernetes deployment logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
- Verify that the `kubeconfig` is correctly set in GitHub Secrets.
- Ensure that the correct namespace and environment are specified in the deployment YAML.

## 4. DNS Issues
### Cause:
- Incorrect DNS configuration.
- Route53 record not created.

### Solution:
- Verify that the DNS records are correctly configured in AWS Route53.
- Check the `dns-manager.sh` script for any issues related to DNS record creation.
